# Android-Basics-Affirmations-App

### What I learned
* How to add images to the list of displayed affirmations in a RecyclerView.
* How to use MaterialCardView in a RecyclerView item layout.
* How to make visual changes in the UI to make the app look more polished.

### What I built
* âœ… A polished Affirmations app that uses a RecyclerView to display a list of cards. Each card contains an image and affirmation text.

_*Based on Google's official training pathway (Unit 2: Layouts)_
